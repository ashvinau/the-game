        <h1>The Dwarf Helps</h1>
        <p> The dwarf informs you that you are travelling through the notorious Black 
           Forest, known for hundreds of years for being a refuge for displaced members
            of society; witches, cast-away warriors, thieves and murderers. He intstucts 
            you to not stop except to give your horse food and water and continue to the 
            town which the dwarf calls "Seldomtown."</p>
        <p>Inquire whether the dwarf has a map to get there.</p>
