        <h1>Black Forest</h1>
        <p>You traverse down the steep canyon you are overlooking, horse by your side, 
        one perilous shuffle of foot movements at a time. You will follow a 
        narrow, winding river that cuts through the treachorous canyon. This canyon leads 
        through a meadow which subsequently leads to a dark forest, the Black Forest. </p>
        <p>The Black Forest is filled with twisted trees and birds making eerie calls as 
        if they are stuck in a place they cannot escape. Continuing through 
        the forest you come across a cabin with an earthen roof with plants and small shrubs 
        growing atop it. </p>  
        <p>Knock on the door of this oddly-built hut or continue through the Black Forest.</p>
