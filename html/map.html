        <h1>The Dwarf Helps</h1>
        <p>You ask the dwarf for a map in hopes of finding what is beyond the town. 
        The dwarf gives you a detailed map of the whole area and shows you where a cave
        is which contains riches and ancient artifacts. You travel through the Black 
        Forest as hastily as possible and arrive at the gates of city of Deepwell.</p>
        <p>Enter the gates:</p>
